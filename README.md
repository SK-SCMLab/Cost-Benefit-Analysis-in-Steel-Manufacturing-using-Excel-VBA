## ðŸ’° Cost Benefit Analysis
Every solution should be evaluated on the cost to implement it and the benefits realized from it

### Net Present Value (NPV)
NPV takes the initial costs and expected net benefits of each solution and converts them into present day dollars
-             Profitability = NPV (Net Benefits) - Initial Cost

### Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
It is the discounted rate wehre NPV = 0. If the value is less than cost of capital, solution is not implemented due to benefit constraints

### Solution Screening
- It is a theoritical approach
- It is evaluated using Cost and Benefit Analysis
- The test is prioritized from brainstorming exercises
- It is screened with potential success with **Piloting**

### Piloting
Piloting is a technique for deploying solution or change in small teams or groups. It is used to deploy solution to:
- 10% of entire scope
- 40% of entire scope
- Remaining 50% of the entire scope

### Pilot Validation
At each phase in the pilot:-
